	*minor update simply to fix Italian language install issues yet again. Added French language and fixed minor issues with install lang file issue. Minor changes to some templates to correct the thread displaying oddly in 1.8.x. added download folder in images as I had forgotten to include that as before users added it manually and since it is needed I added it. Disabled one particular input as it was causing errors. Just a simple update to get the plugin working again, add further localization support and touch up other minor changes here and there.

Version 1.0
It is a plugin to develop which it does is to add a page to download .. more you download is a linkeo since overwhelm your space. In my opinion it is a well-developed plugin and I dare say that cost me maybe a little more than the PIP as its administration panel is very well developed!
The plugin creates a 'panel' in the ACP called Downloads where within that encounter.

Files 
In this part you show files or downloads and created, from there you can modify, delete or make new ones. Inside you can put new file name, short description, description broadly (HTML accepted), cover, order, file url, if you can comment on that download, select the category, if that discharge will be active, user groups NO can see that and how many images will download. Then from there you create the download and will be visible to users.


Categories 
As mentioned above the files are put to a category and from that module believe it. appear on page downloads.php actegorias list and from there you enter a category and within this will be the files category.


Validate downloads 
Well this was the last option that adds to the plugin, mmm good to go into any category (normal user) appears in the list of topics forumdisplay and up and down the new topic button, it is the same except that in downloads page then from there users can also create downloads.
To avoid unwanted things such as a spammer in porografia and downloads from the configuration can be set if downloads are validated or not if you put that if validated in this module downloads all downloads were added entnces created as a user if I do not think shock be shown until an administrator or anyone with access to the ACP to validate the download ..


More Options 
Well in this option lists all the files or downloads, and though a small table on which are
Topic
Posts
Reputation
Time Online 

this is so that in each of the downloads can implement an optional extra for example: There is a discharge of an operating system created private and I think that is very very good download from this module 'plus' Find the download and put edit and put only the user can view more than 10 topics, 80 posts, 15 reputation and more than 15 days online and only users who meet these requirements may view the download. Within this module is the option (on a tab) massive editing that does the same but editing all downloads or all discharges within a category.
